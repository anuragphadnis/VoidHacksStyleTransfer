# Pixeffect
This is a project developed for Void Hacks Hackathon for the Machine Learning track. The problem statement asked to create an application which is capable of doing style transfer on human images.

The Web App provides three option for styling image on given 4 styles:
- foreground : to style only foreground i.e where human figure is present.
- background : to style only foreground i.e where human figure is not present.
- complete : to style complete image
  

The App is also capable of styling images containing no human figures provided the complete mode is selected.
